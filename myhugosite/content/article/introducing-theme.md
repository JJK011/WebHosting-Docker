About 4.5 billion years ago, the planets of our solar system, including Earth, were formed. Life began about 3.5 billion years ago. But was the origin of life something that happened deep within Earth itself, or did a comet or asteroid carrying the seeds of life crash onto Earth by chance? That still remains a mystery.

Human evolution began roughly 5 million years ago, but it took nearly 4.9 million years after that before the first real human settlements appeared. Those early hunters gradually became aware of their surroundings, learning how to use the environment for their development. Over time, they became farmers, engineers, artists, astronomers—everything they were capable of becoming.

From ancient times, humans have been fascinated by the star-filled sky above them. Today, we call it the universe. Space exploration began in the 1950s, and it has greatly expanded our understanding of the cosmos. Yet, the questions never end, because every answer leads to even more questions. Each question about the universe is, in some way, a question about ourselves.

How fascinating it is that a telescope can show us things that happened millions of years ago! Even when we look at the Sun, what we see is the Sun as it was 8 minutes earlier. Those eight light-minutes are now treated as a unit of distance—what we call an Astronomical Unit (AU).

Space technology has benefited humanity in countless ways: environmental protection, weather forecasting, global communication, healthcare, and much more. But perhaps the most important contribution is the insight it gives us about ourselves as a species. Talking about space is a constant reminder of what humanity has already achieved and of the long journey of achievements still ahead of us.

So, when the universe continues to amaze us every single moment, why shouldn’t an ordinary person study it? Space is such a vast subject that anyone can find something within it to spark their curiosity. There is truly something for everyone in “space.” By spending a little time learning about our cosmic home and understanding our place within it, the next time a great discovery is announced, we’ll all be able to celebrate it deeply in our hearts—rather than just glance at it as another newspaper headline.
